# Basic-WebPage
Very Basic Webpage that includes forms and tables using basic HTML and CSS. 

I have developed a webpage that includes forms and tables using basic HTML and CSS. This update represents the initial version of the webpage, showcasing its structure and styling. It includes interactive forms for user input and tables to display data.

Feel free to customize this description to provide more specific details about your webpage or any other relevant information you'd like to include.
